# RCL-2 Implementation Status

> **Last Updated**: February 6, 2026

## 🎯 Quick Answer: What's Done?

**Short Answer**: Phases 2A, 2B, and 2D are complete (35% of total vision). The core cognitive architecture, safety controls, and multi-agent governance are operational. **GUI integration (Phase 2H) and advanced features (2C, 2E-F-G) are next.**

---

## ✅ COMPLETED (3 of 8 Major Phases)

### Phase 2A: Cognitive Core ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**File**: `lollmsbot/cognitive_core.py` (620 lines)

**What it does**:
- **System 1 (Intuitive)**: Fast, subsymbolic self-awareness
  - Converts entropy/attention into "gut feelings" (CONFIDENT, UNCERTAIN, ANXIOUS, etc.)
  - Attention heatmaps
  - Entropy gradients
  - Latent space trajectory tracking

- **System 2 (Analytical)**: Slow, deliberative metacognition
  - Counterfactual simulation (3 parallel paths: optimistic/pessimistic/alternative)
  - Epistemic status tracking (source reliability, decay functions)
  - Contradiction detection with cascade invalidation
  - Expected utility calculation

**Integration**: ✅ Integrated with SelfAwarenessManager

---

### Phase 2B: Constitutional Restraints ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**File**: `lollmsbot/constitutional_restraints.py` (550 lines + 180 for audit trail)

**What it does**:
- **12-Dimensional Control Matrix** (all continuous 0.0-1.0):
  
  | Category | Parameters | Description |
  |----------|-----------|-------------|
  | **Cognitive Budgeting** | recursion_depth, cognitive_budget_ms, simulation_fidelity | How much System-2 thinking to allow |
  | **Epistemic Virtues** | hallucination_resistance, uncertainty_propagation, contradiction_sensitivity | Truth-seeking behaviors |
  | **Social Cognition** | user_model_fidelity, transparency_level, explanation_depth | User interaction style |
  | **Autonomy & Growth** | self_modification_freedom, goal_inference_autonomy, memory_consolidation_rate | Self-improvement capacity |

- **Cryptographic Hard-Stops**: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification prevents exceeding limits
- **Audit Trail**: Blockchain-style immutable log of all restraint changes
- **Dynamic Policy**: Adjusts based on task criticality and user expertise

**Configuration**: ✅ All 12 dimensions in `.env.example`

---

### Phase 2D: Reflective Council ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**File**: `lollmsbot/reflective_council.py` (650 lines)

**What it does**:
- **5 Council Members** (Society of Mind architecture):
  - `GuardianRep`: Safety/security perspective (can veto dangerous actions)
  - `TruthRep`: Accuracy/fact-checking (Epistemologist)
  - `UtilityRep`: Efficiency/goal achievement (Strategist)
  - `UserModelRep`: UX/satisfaction (Empath)
  - `MemoryRep`: Consistency/history (Historian)

- **Deliberation Process**:
  - Parallel perspective gathering (all 5 evaluate simultaneously)
  - Conflict detection (when members disagree)
  - Escalation protocols (human oversight when needed)
  - Unanimous or majority decisions
  - Complete audit trail of deliberations

**Usage**: High-stakes decisions trigger council deliberation

---

### Killer Features (Integration Layer) ✅
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Files**: Enhanced `self_awareness.py`, `constitutional_restraints.py`

1. **Cognitive Debt Forecasting**: System-1 shortcuts are tracked and repaid during idle time with System-2 verification
2. **System-1 Markers in Context**: All decisions enriched with "gut feelings" (8 somatic marker types)
3. **Restraint Audit Trail**: Immutable, tamper-evident log with hash chain verification

---

## ⏳ REMAINING (5 Major Phases + Integration)

### Phase 2C: Cognitive Digital Twin ⏳
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated**: ~400 lines  
**File**: `lollmsbot/cognitive_twin.py` (to be created)

**What it will do**:
- Predict latency (how long responses will take)
- Forecast memory pressure (when context window will saturate)
- Pre-load skills (predict what's needed next)
- Predict user satisfaction/engagement
- Auto-trigger self-healing (e.g., retrieval augmentation when hallucination risk high)

**Why important**: Proactive rather than reactive - prevents problems before they occur

---

### Phase 2E: Narrative Identity Engine ⏳
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated**: ~350 lines  
**File**: `lollmsbot/narrative_identity.py` (to be created)

**What it will do**:
- Maintain "life story" of the agent (biographical continuity)
- Consolidation events during idle time (like sleep)
- Track developmental stages (learning curves)
- Prevent dissociative episodes (contradicting past self)
- Cognitive maturity metrics

**Why important**: Temporal continuity - the agent has a coherent identity over time

---

### Phase 2F: Eigenmemory System ⏳
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated**: ~400 lines  
**File**: `lollmsbot/eigenmemory.py` (to be created)

**What it will do**:
- Source monitoring: Distinguish episodic/semantic/confabulated memories
- Metamemory queries: "Do I know X?", "Do I remember saying Y?"
- Strategic forgetting: Decay low-value memories, consolidate important patterns
- Intentional amnesia: GDPR-compliant ability to forget on command

**Why important**: Memory about memory - metacognitive awareness of what's known/unknown

---

### Phase 2G: Introspection Query Language (IQL v2) ⏳
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated**: ~300 lines  
**File**: `lollmsbot/introspection_query_language.py` (to be created)

**What it will do**:
```sql
INTROSPECT {
    SELECT uncertainty_distribution, attention_focus, epistemic_status
    FROM current_cognitive_state
    WHERE topic = "last_decision"
    DEPTH 3
    WITH transparency = "full"
    CONSTRAINT max_latency = 200ms
}
```

- Formal query syntax for self-examination
- Typed returns with constraint satisfaction
- Reflexive debugging (post-mortem analysis)
- Root cause analysis for errors

**Why important**: Structured introspection - query internal state like a database

---

## 🎯 What Should Come Next?

### Option A: Foundation First (2C → 2E → 2F → 2G → 2H)
**Order**: Complete all backend features, then build GUI

**Pros**:
- Complete feature set before GUI work
- No need to update GUI as features added
- Backend fully tested before exposure

**Cons**:
- GUI comes last (violates "immaculate representation" requirement emphasis)
- Can't use features until GUI built
- Longer time to user-visible value

**Timeline**: ~2 weeks to full completion

---

### Option B: GUI First (2H → then 2C/E/F/G incrementally) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Order**: Build GUI for existing features, add backend features later

**Pros**:
- ✅ Satisfies "immaculate GUI representation" requirement immediately
- ✅ Users can use powerful existing features (restraints, council, debt)
- ✅ Validates architecture through UI work
- ✅ Incremental feature additions easier
- ✅ Provides user-visible value quickly

**Cons**:
- GUI needs updates as new features added
- Some visualizations (twin predictions, narrative timeline) come later

**Timeline**: ~1 week for GUI, then features incrementally

---

### Option C: Minimal Viable Product (2H partial + 2C)
**Order**: Basic GUI + most impactful feature

**Components**:
- Restraint sliders (basic)
- Council viewer (basic)
- Cognitive twin (most impactful missing feature)

**Pros**:
- Fastest to basic usability
- Can assess user feedback before continuing

**Cons**:
- Incomplete implementation
- May need rework based on feedback

**Timeline**: ~3-4 days

---

## 💬 Decision Point

**What would you like me to do next?**

- **A**: Continue with backend features (2C → 2E → 2F → 2G), then GUI (2H)
- **B**: Build GUI first (2H), then add features incrementally ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- **C**: Minimal viable product (2H partial + 2C)
- **D**: Something else (please specify)

**My strong recommendation is Option B** because:
1. Requirements emphasized GUI ("ALL need immaculate representation")
2. We have powerful features ready to showcase (restraints, council, cognitive debt)
3. Users can immediately interact with RCL-2
4. Validates architecture before building more
5. Incremental is better than big-bang

## 📦 What You Can Use TODAY

Even without the remaining phases, you can use:

```python
# Dual-process cognition
from lollmsbot.cognitive_core import get_cognitive_core
core = get_cognitive_core()
state = await core.process_system1(entropy=0.7, attention=[...])
state = await core.process_system2(decision="...", context={...})

# Constitutional restraints (12D control)
from lollmsbot.constitutional_restraints import get_constitutional_restraints
restraints = get_constitutional_restraints()
restraints.set_dimension(RestraintDimension.RECURSION_DEPTH, 0.8)
trail = restraints.get_audit_trail()

# Multi-agent deliberation
from lollmsbot.reflective_council import get_reflective_council, ProposedAction
council = get_reflective_council()
result = await council.deliberate(action)

# Cognitive debt management
from lollmsbot.self_awareness import get_awareness_manager
manager = get_awareness_manager()
debt_id = manager.log_decision("decision", confidence=0.6)
await manager.repay_cognitive_debt(debt_id)
```

**What's missing**: GUI to control/visualize all this!
